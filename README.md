# Listaroo

**Listaroo** is a simple shopping list app developed using SwiftUI. This project was created as a personal learning exercise to explore iOS development concepts such as state management, data persistence, and UI customization. The project also marks a collaboration with the AI tool, ChatGPT, which assisted in implementing several features and resolving issues during development.
## Features

- Create shopping lists: Add, edit, and delete shopping lists.

- Add items: Within each list, you can add items with different price types (per unit or by weight).

- Automatic total calculation: The total price of the items is automatically calculated for both selected items and all items.

- Edit items: Items can be edited at any time without losing the total price calculation.

- Data persistence: Lists are saved locally on the device using `UserDefaults`.
## Technologies Used

**SwiftUI:** Framework used to build the user interface declaratively.

**Combine:** Used for reactivity and state management between the ViewModel and Views.

**UserDefaults:** For local persistence of shopping lists.
